## [2022-06-06]

### Added

- Magic comment for [LTeX](https://github.com/valentjn/vscode-ltex#ltex-extension-for-vs-code-grammarspell-checker-using-languagetool-with-support-for-latex-markdown-and-others) (because of [vscode-ltex#632](https://github.com/valentjn/vscode-ltex/issues/632))

## [2022-02-28]

### Added

- Added package [mindflow](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/mindflow), which supports quickly noting down thoughts with a) a proper rendering of LaTeX and b) a proper differentiation from the main text

### Removed

- Removed `paper-conference-compsoc.tex` as the option `compsoc` is not in use any more.
- Removed `paper-9pt-technote.tex` as that format is not used at all.

### Changed

- Now generated using the [latex template generator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/generator-latex-template).
- Updated to TeXLive 2021
- Switch from [balance](https://ctan.org/pkg/balance) to [pbalance](https://ctan.org/pkg/pbalance), because the latter works better in edge cases.
